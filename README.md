This Python code is a simple interactive calculator program that repeatedly prompts the user to input two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or exit).
It runs in an infinite loop (while True) until the user chooses to exit.
It takes two integer inputs from the user.
The user is then presented with a menu to choose the mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or exit).
Depending on the user's choice, the code performs the corresponding operation and displays the result.
If the user chooses division, it checks if the second number is not zero to avoid division by zero.
If the user chooses to exit, the program breaks out of the loop and terminates.
For any other choice not in the range 1-5, it informs the user of a "Wrong choice."
In summary, this code allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations and exit the program when desired.
